# Istanbul Real Estate Price Prediction

This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to predict housing prices in Istanbul based on real estate listings data.  
The dataset was cleaned, processed, and used to train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model.  

## Project Overview
- Dataset: Real estate listings from Istanbul (CSV format)
- Data Cleaning: Removal of outliers, standardization of categorical features, missing value handling
- Feature Engineering: One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Model: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Evaluation Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
